# Introduction-to-Data-Mining
Tasks done at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana that cover Data mining basics.

### Exercise1
Creating clusters from dataset of images. 
Calculating sillhoute, sillhouete average and creating clusters using k-medoids.

### Exercise2
Projections to lower (latent) subspace.
Calculating PCA, MDS, and t-SNE on dataset of languages and representig them in latent subspace.

### Exercise3
Forecasting of bus arrival time (linear regression).
Creating linear regression model and manipulating the original data (creating one-hot encoded, combining data, etc.)

### Exercise4
Forecasting of bus arrival time.
Finding the most suitable method for forecasting arrival time, implementing it and manipulating the original data (see ex3).

### Exercise5
Multinomial logistic regression.
Implementing 'softmax', 'cost', and 'grad' functions. Creating predictions using own k-fold cross-validation.
